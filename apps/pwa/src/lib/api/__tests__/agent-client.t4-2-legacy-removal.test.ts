 * T4.2 (SPEC section 11 E2, ARCH-V4-06a): the PWA has zero external consumers

 * no code outside apps/agent may reference the retired routes/symbols.
 *
 * Chat/history flows use the canonical FinanceChatAgent routes
 * (/agents/finance-chat-agent/:ws/rpc/chat, /rpc/history) — covered by
 * agent-client.test.ts. This file locks the removal contract.
