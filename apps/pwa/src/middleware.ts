/**
 * Next.js 16 middleware — security proxy.
 *
 * Applies security headers and CSP nonce to all routes.
 * Uses experimental-edge runtime for Cloudflare compatibility via OpenNext.
 *
 * ACCEPTED COMPATIBILITY EXCEPTION (Next.js 16 + OpenNext Cloudflare):
 * Next.js 16 recommends src/proxy.ts but a Next 16 proxy.ts cannot set a
 * runtime (build error: "Route segment config is not allowed in Proxy file.
 * Proxy always runs on Node.js runtime.") and always runs on Node.js.
 * OpenNext Cloudflare rejects Node.js middleware
 * ("ERROR Node.js middleware is not currently supported."), which breaks
 * `opennext build`. So the deprecated src/middleware.ts with
 * `runtime = "experimental-edge"` is REQUIRED for the deploy to build.
 * The Next 16 middleware.ts deprecation *warning* is non-fatal; the OpenNext
 * Node.js rejection is fatal. Do NOT "fix" the warning by renaming to proxy.ts.
 *
 * MIGRATION TRIGGER — switch to src/proxy.ts only when BOTH hold:
 *   1. OpenNext Cloudflare no longer errors "Node.js middleware is not
 *      currently supported" (after upgrading @opennextjs/cloudflare), AND
 *   2. Next.js (16+) allows an Edge runtime in proxy.ts (a `runtime` export
 *      is currently rejected).
