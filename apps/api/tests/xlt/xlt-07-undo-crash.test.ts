/**
 * XLT-07 — Undo crash atomicity (SPEC §12 F1–F4, D-V4-07; T3.1; VAL-V4.7).
 *
 * Crosses ≥ 2 real layers: real PostgreSQL (canonical schema, SQL tx
 * semantics) × the production Postgres write/idempotency/audit stores × the
 * canonical undo service. Gated by DATABASE_URL_TEST + DB_TEST_MARKER; skips
 * cleanly otherwise (same gate as tests/integration/postgres-undo.test.ts).
 *
 * CRASH EQUIVALENCE (header contract): a real process crash mid-transaction
 * aborts the open transaction (the server rolls back everything the crashed
 * backend had not committed). Injecting a deterministic fault that throws
 * inside the transaction callback — before COMMIT — produces EXACTLY the
 * database state a crash at that point would leave: uncommitted work is
 * rolled back, previously-committed transactions stay committed. What the
 * fault CANNOT simulate (documented per scenario) is client-side amnesia,
 * which is instead simulated by rebuilding the undo service with a fresh
 * `undone` set before replay (= a new process after the crash).
 *
 * THE 5 CRASH POINTS (SPEC §12.F2):
 *   P1 — before the financial reversal (no statement ran);
 *   P2 — during the reversal (mid-statement failure);
 *   P3 — after the reversal, before the idempotency completion write;
 *   P4 — after the completion write, before COMMIT;
 *   P5 — after COMMIT (clean path + replay control).
 *
 * Each scenario asserts: 0 OR 1 financial effect (never double) + convergent
 * replay (retry the undo after the crash → single correct final effect, the
 * recorded idempotency result, replay observable). FIX-UNDO (T3.1→F3,
 * SPEC §12 F3 opção 1) joined claim + reversal + completion in ONE Postgres
 * transaction (claim-client passthrough to the producer, client-bound `*InTx`
 * reversals): P3/P4 now assert FULL rollback (0 effects, 0 records) plus a
 * convergent, byte-identical, replay-marked retry. The pre-fix RED shape
 * (committed effect + lost record → `not_found` 404 on retry, F4 violated)
 * is recorded in docs/reports/meu-ted-v4-implementation-report.md (Fase 3).
 *
 * STORE PARITY — T3.2 Opção A (SPEC §12 F1): the same P1–P5 points run
 * against the in-memory stores (dev/test) at the REPRESENTABLE boundaries.
 * A heap-only store cannot represent torn state: a real process crash loses
 * heap effect + heap claim together, and the in-memory producer is one
 * synchronous atomic step — a fault either fires BEFORE it (≡ crash-before)
 * or AFTER it (≡ crash-after). There is no observable mid-point, so P1/P2
 * are observably identical in-memory and P3/P4 collapse onto the two
 * boundaries. The PROOF of production atomicity is the Postgres path (13/13
 * real above); the in-memory store guarantees equivalent OBSERVABLE replay
 * semantics: processing-claim → completed upgrade (parity with the
 * claim→complete lifecycle in writes/postgres.ts), takeover of an orphan
 * claim by a same-payload retry, retained failed claims, conflict on
 * divergent payload. The previous DIVERGE_TODAY middle scenario (effect
 * kept, record lost, retry throws) simulated a state no real heap crash can
 * leave and is therefore NOT asserted — instead the invariant ≤1 financial
 * effect in EVERY observable interleaving is assembled explicitly below.
 *
 * LEGACY BRANCH (§31.3.2): the canonical undo path is asserted via the
 * `audit-undo:` namespace row + canonical audit row. The "legacy branch is
 * never executed" claim is QUALIFIED, not repeated blindly — see the
 * legacy-branch test.
 *
 * EMITTERS (T0.4.5/T0.4.6, born here): `audit-undo.replay` (undo is a replay
 * — the idempotency store already distinguishes it) and
 * `mutation.reconcile.enqueued` (operation enters reconcile). Both are
 * validated by buildObservabilityEvent + best-effort structured logging,
 * following the T2.2 precedent in routes/index.ts. The replay emitter is
 * ALSO the observable "marked as replay" signal: UndoResult carries no
 * replayed flag, but a replayed call emits exactly 1 event AND returns a
 * byte-identical recorded response (a fresh execution would mint a new
 * receipt mutationId — see resolveUndoReceipt).
